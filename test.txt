Ellen Anderson Gholson Glasgow (April 22, 1873 – November 21, 1945) was an American novelist who portrayed the changing world of the contemporary South.
Crabwalk, published in Germany in 2002 as Im Krebsgang, is a novel by Danzig-born German author Günter Grass. As in earlier works, Grass concerns himself with the effects of the past on the present; he interweaves various strands and combines fact and fiction. While the murder of Wilhelm Gustloff by David Frankfurter and the sinking of the ship the "Wilhelm Gustloff" are real events, the fictional members of the Pokriefke family bring these events into our own time.
Virginia (1913) is a novel by Ellen Glasgow about a wife and mother who in vain seeks happiness by serving her family. This novel, her eleventh, marked a clear departure from Glasgow's previous work—she had written a series of bestsellers before publishing "Virginia"—in that it attacked, in a subtle yet unmistakable way, the very layer of society that constituted her readership. Also, as its heroine, though virtuous and god-fearing, is denied the happiness she is craving, its plot did not live up to readers' expectations as far as poetic justice is concerned and was bound to upset some of them. Today, "Virginia" is seen by many as an outstanding achievement in Glasgow's career, exactly because the author defied literary convention by questioning the foundations of American society around the dawn of the 20th century, be it capitalism, religion or racism.
The Tin Drum (German: "Die Blechtrommel" ) is a 1959 novel by Günter Grass. The novel is the first book of Grass's "Danziger Trilogie " (Danzig Trilogy) and winner of the Nobel Prize in literature. It was adapted into a 1979 film, which won both the Palme d'Or, in the same year, and the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film the following year.
The Box (German: Die Box ) is a 2008 fictionalised autobiography by the German writer Günter Grass. It has the subtitle "Tales from the Darkroom" ("Dunkelkammergeschichten"). In the narrative, the 80-year-old Grass' eight children, at their father's request, record conversations where they say what they think of him. "The Box" follows the writer's previous memoir book, "Peeling the Onion" from 2006, which ended in 1959 with the literary success of "The Tin Drum". It was followed by "Grimm's Words" in 2010.
The Meeting at Telgte (German: Das Treffen in Telgte ) is a 1979 novel by the West German writer Günter Grass. The narrative revolves around a fictional meeting for intellectuals hosted by Simon Dach after the Thirty Years' War. The story is an analogy for the post-World War II society in Germany, and of Group 47 in West Germany, of which Grass was a member.
